I will be doing an Odin recipes web page for this part of my project on 03/13/2022 by Bonnie Hensley.
On 03/15/2022 I have created 3 pages of recipes. I have put h1 heading into all 3 recipe pages as well as the main page.
I have put in a background color in for each and every page.
I have added links from the home page to all three separate recipes pages.
Have added images of the done recipe. centered the images and made the images an appropriate size.
I have given the image a paragraph description.
I have put in a unordered list for the ingredients.
In the Directions list i have put in a ordered list of the recipes steps.
I have put in a return to main page link.
