        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        &nbsp;
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>½ cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 Tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        &nbsp;
        <ol>
            <li>In a large liquid measuring cup or batter bowl with a spout, whisk together milk, egg, water and vanilla.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Add sugar, baking powder and salt and whisk until combined.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Add the flour, and whisk until completely smooth. Set aside.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>In a medium, deep-sided pan or pot, heat 1" of oil to 375°F over medium-high heat. When you put the end of a wooden spoon in the pot and bubbles form around the spoon, it's ready. Reduce heat to medium.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Drizzle batter from cup in a thin line, swirling around the pan and overlapping as desired. Cook for 2 minutes or until light golden brown, then flip and cook another 2 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Dust with 2 tablespoons powdered sugar and serve. Repeat one more time with the remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
